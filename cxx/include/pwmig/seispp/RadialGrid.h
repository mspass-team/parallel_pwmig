/*! \brief Define a global radial grid.

A radial grid on the earth is best thought a set of generalized coordinates
with the an origin that acts like a pole.  Great circle paths to
a specified distance in degrees are defined from that point at uniform
(specified) angles.  This operator maps a port or all of a sphere onto
a circle.   The sectors in the resulting circle define positions within
a range of angles and distances for great circle paths emenating from the
pole.   This grid is used in the telecluster program of pwmig to
assemble sources in a epicentral distance and azimuth bins.  The grid
can be uniform or nonuniform.  Use the parameterized constructor to
create a uniform grid and the AntelopePf constructor to create a
grid with variable distance or azimuth grids.
