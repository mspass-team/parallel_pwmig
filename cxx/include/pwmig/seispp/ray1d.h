/*! \brief Computes a simple ray path for a radially symmetric earth model.
*
* Rays are a common concept used in global scale seismology.  This
* object constructs a ray path in a radially symmetric earth for
* a specified ray parameter to a specified depth or travel time
* from the surface.  Construction of the object creates the
* path desired so the model for use is to call the constructor
* and then extract the path from the internal data attributes.
* The generated path is always oriented from the surface downward.
* i.e. the first point in the computed path is at Earth's surface.
* \par
* This algorithm runs in either equal time step or equal depth step
* mode.  Depth steps are exact while time steps are a target time
* increment only.
* \par
 * Note that we have to handle the common situation of a turning
 * ray.  That is, if zmax is below the turning point of a ray
 * with the requested ray parameter we handle this specially because
 * if we did not the travel time formulae contain sqrt of negative
 * numbers.  This is handled in a simple way here by simply stopping
 * the ray tracing if the next point down goes singular.  Whether
 * this is important to the caller depends on the use.  Rather than
 * throw an exception, which isn't necessary really, the user is
 * simply warned that they should test the actual output's maximum
 * depth compared to zmax when this is a problem.
 *
 * A similar feature is implemented when running in equal time
 * step mode.  This could do nasty things too if the requested
 * zmax was very close to a turning point.  It is possible in
 * this situation that the function could try to compute a vector
 * that is unbounded because the dz step length for each dt
 * gets tiny.  To avoid this we also include the tmax parameter.
 * The ray is truncated when either z>zmax or t>tmax.  If you
 * are sure the ray won't bottom for the requested p simply make
 * tmax large.
