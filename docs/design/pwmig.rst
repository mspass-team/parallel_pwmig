pwmig
============
As the end of the chain this is the most uncertain design.   A key initial
design is if we retain the current structure and build an input file to
drive a single event imaging step or redesign pwmig as a reduce function.
A key point for the later that I'm not sure about is at what level the
imaging step is commutative - required by reduce.
